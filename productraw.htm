                    <p>Charcoal is a widely used natural resource in globally, primarily produced from hardwoods through a controlled process of carbonization. It serves as an essential energy source for heating, and is also used in industrial applications such as metal smelting. Nigeria is one of the largest producers and exporters of charcoal in Africa, with major production hubs in states like Oyo, Ondo, and Ogun. With Larryakins headquaters locatedat Ogun we are one of Nigeria's main Charcoal exporters The demand for Nigerian charcoal continues to grow globally, driven by its high quality and sustainable production practices.
                        Our monthly ability to export Charcoal is of 350MT per month.

                    <p>


Manganese is a significant mineral, extensively used in various industries worldwide. It is essential in steel production, contributing to its strength and hardness. Moreover, manganese is a key component in the manufacturing of batteries, especially in the cathodes of lithium-ion batteries. Nigeria contributes to to the supply of manganese, although on a smaller scale, with Larry akins being on of the major western Nigera manganese exporters. The demand for manganese is increasing due to its critical role in industrial applications and the growing emphasis on sustainable extraction methods.
With our Mines and  warehouses in Ogun state and kebbi we are positioned to supply 250-300MT of this product monthly.
